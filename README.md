# Waldur Keycloak mapper

Custom Keycloak OIDC protocol mappers that integrate with [Waldur](https://waldur.com/) so OIDC tokens reflect Waldur permissions, offering access, and per-offering identities. The build produces a single shaded JAR that operators drop into Keycloak's providers directory; Keycloak picks it up via SPI on next start.

## What's in the box

| Display name in Keycloak           | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Waldur preferred username mapper` | Adds the per-offering preferred username from Waldur as a custom claim.                              |
| `Waldur offering access mapper`    | Checks per-user offering access in Waldur and **mutates** Keycloak group/role membership accordingly. |
| `Waldur MinIO mapper`              | Adds a comma-separated list of customer or project UUIDs as a claim, intended for MinIO policy mapping. |

All three mappers register under the standard `Token mapper` category in the Keycloak admin UI (Clients → *your client* → Client scopes → Mappers).

## Mappers

### Waldur preferred username mapper

Resolves a user's preferred username for a specific Waldur offering and emits it as an OIDC claim on the ID token, access token, and userinfo response.

**Configuration**

| Parameter        | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waldur API URL   | Base URL with **trailing slash**, e.g. `https://waldur.example.com/api/`.    |
| Offering UUID    | UUID of the Waldur offering to look up the username in.                      |
| API Token        | Waldur API token (sent as `Authorization: Token <token>`).                   |
| TLS Validation   | When off, disables **both** hostname and certificate-chain verification.     |
| Claim Name       | OIDC claim name to write the username into.                                  |

### Waldur offering access mapper

On every token issuance, asks Waldur whether the user has access to the configured offering and reconciles Keycloak state to match: joins/leaves a configured group and grants/revokes a configured role.

> **Heads up — side effects.** This mapper *mutates* Keycloak user-group and user-role state during token issuance. That's unusual for an OIDC mapper. Be deliberate about which clients trigger it and how often tokens are minted.

**Configuration**

| Parameter           | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waldur API URL      | Base URL with trailing slash.                                                |
| Offering UUID       | UUID of the offering to check access against.                                |
| API Token           | Waldur API token.                                                            |
| Username Source     | `id` (Keycloak user ID) or `username`.                                       |
| Group name          | Group to add/remove the user from. The mapper resolves it as `/<name>`; nested groups are not supported. |
| Add to group        | If off, group membership is not touched.                                     |
| Role name           | Realm role to grant/revoke.                                                  |
| Assign role         | If off, role assignment is not touched.                                      |
| Claim Name          | OIDC claim name to write group info into (optional).                         |

TLS validation is **always strict** for this mapper — there is no toggle.

### Waldur MinIO mapper

Aggregates the user's Waldur permissions at customer or project scope and emits the matching scope UUIDs as a comma-separated string under a single claim. MinIO can then map that claim to its policy engine.

**Configuration**

| Parameter        | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waldur API URL   | Base URL with trailing slash.                                                |
| API Token        | Waldur API token.                                                            |
| Permission Scope | `customer` or `project`.                                                     |
| TLS Validation   | When off, disables both hostname and certificate-chain verification.         |
| Username Source  | `id` (Keycloak user ID) or `username`.                                       |
| Claim Name       | OIDC claim name to write the UUID list into (e.g. `policy`).                 |

**Example claim payload.** For a user who is owner in customers `C1`, `C2` (with `Permission Scope = customer` and `Claim Name = policy`):

```json
{
  "policy": "c1-uuid-here,c2-uuid-here"
}
```

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 17** (the project compiles to `--release 17`).
- **Maven 3.6+**.
- **Docker** — only needed for integration tests (`mvn verify`).

### Build

```bash
mvn clean install            # compile, run unit tests, build shaded JAR (skips ITs)
mvn -B verify                # also runs the Testcontainers-based integration test
mvn clean install -DskipTests   # skip all tests
```

The shaded JAR lands at `target/waldur-keycloak-mapper-<version>.jar`. Locally, `<version>` falls back to the `<revision>` property in `pom.xml` (currently `1.4.0`); CI overrides it via `-Drevision=<tag>`.

### Tests

- **Unit tests** under `src/test/java/...` — verify URL construction and special-character encoding.
- **Integration test** (`KeycloakProviderIT`) — boots a Keycloak container with the freshly-built JAR mounted as a provider and asserts that all three mappers register. Auto-skips when Docker isn't available. The image registry can be overridden with `-Ddocker.registry.prefix=` (default mirrors via `registry.hpc.ut.ee/mirror/`).

## Installation in Keycloak

1. Grab the JAR from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/waldur/waldur-keycloak-mapper/releases/) page (or build it yourself).

2. Drop it into Keycloak's [providers directory](https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration-provider#_installing_and_uninstalling_a_provider). For a Docker-based deployment:

   ```yaml
   services:
     keycloak:
       image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.0
       command: start-dev
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
       volumes:
         - ./waldur-keycloak-mapper-1.4.0.jar:/opt/keycloak/providers/waldur-keycloak-mapper-1.4.0.jar
   ```

   The leading `./` matters — without it Docker Compose treats the entry as a named volume rather than a bind mount.

3. Restart Keycloak so the SPI loader picks up the new provider.

4. In the admin console, configure the mappers under **Clients → _your client_ → Client scopes → _scope_ → Mappers → Add mapper → By configuration**. Pick one of the three display names listed at the top of this README.

## Compatibility

| Mapper version | Keycloak | Java |
| -------------- | -------- | ---- |
| 1.4.x          | 26.x     | 17   |

Older mapper versions targeted earlier Keycloak releases; check [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and the release notes if you need to pin to an older line.

## Releasing

Releases are developer-driven, not CI-automated:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh 1.4.0       # bumps <revision>, generates a CHANGELOG entry, commits, tags
git push origin master --tags    # CI picks up the tag and publishes the GitHub release
```

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full release-flow notes.
